Knight and Queens Problem Using Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing Algorithm
 • The code takes seven command line arguments, which are as follows: o num_row, num_column, num_queens, num_knights, tmax, output_file, and method_name. 
• methodname accepts HC or SA
 • tmax should not be greater than 120s 
• filename should also include extension (eg solution.txt) 
• The sample command lines to execute the code for Hill Climbing is: 
• python KnightsAndQueens.py 15 15 15 15 120 solution.txt HC
